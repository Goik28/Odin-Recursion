# Recursion
This is my take on the Recursion project from The Odin Project, javascript course.
The objective of this project was:
To develop a function that prints the fibonacci sequence to the n digit and a mergeSort algorithm.

## Subject
The project should use recursion. For the fibonacci, it should have an iterable version too.
